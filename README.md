# TinyNetLab

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ README](docs/README.zh.md)

**A minimal neural network built from scratch in pure NumPy to intuitively understand how neural networks learn nonlinear decision boundaries. Visualize. Experiment. Build your intuition.**

## ðŸŒŸ What is TinyNetLab?

**TinyNetLab** is a hands-on educational project where you build and train a neural network from the ground up â€” no frameworks, no magic. Just pure NumPy code that shows you:

âœ… How forward propagation works
âœ… How gradients flow in backpropagation
âœ… How gradient descent updates parameters
âœ… How neural networks learn to draw complex decision boundaries

Youâ€™ll see it all in action by training on a simple **2D moons dataset** (a classic for testing nonlinear classifiers) and visualizing the decision boundary as it evolves.

## ðŸ§  Why use TinyNetLab?

* **Understand, donâ€™t just use:** Go beyond black-box libraries â€” see the math at work.
* **Minimal but meaningful:** A small network (2-4-1) thatâ€™s powerful enough to learn nonlinear boundaries.
* **Visual + interactive:** Watch your neural net *draw* the boundary as it learns.
* **Easy to hack:** Modify the number of neurons, activations, layers, learning rates â€” and instantly see what changes.

## ðŸš€ Features

* One hidden layer, ReLU activations
* Output sigmoid + cross-entropy loss
* Manual forward and backward propagation
* Fully vectorized NumPy implementation
* Decision boundary visualization
* Clear, well-commented code

## ðŸŽ¨ Example decision boundary

*(You can insert a generated plot here, e.g., after training 2000 epochs)*
