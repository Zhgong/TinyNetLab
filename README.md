# TinyNetLab

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ README](docs/README.zh.md)

**A minimal neural network built from scratch in pure NumPy to intuitively understand how neural networks learn nonlinear decision boundaries. Visualize. Experiment. Build your intuition.**

## ðŸŒŸ What is TinyNetLab?

**TinyNetLab** is a hands-on educational project where you build and train a neural network from the ground up â€” no frameworks, no magic. Just pure NumPy code that shows you:

âœ… How forward propagation works
âœ… How gradients flow in backpropagation
âœ… How gradient descent updates parameters
âœ… How neural networks learn to draw complex decision boundaries

Youâ€™ll see it all in action by training on a simple **2D moons dataset** (a classic for testing nonlinear classifiers) and visualizing the decision boundary as it evolves.

## ðŸ§  Why use TinyNetLab?

- **Understand, donâ€™t just use:** Go beyond black-box libraries â€” see the math at work.
- **Minimal but meaningful:** A small network (2-4-1) thatâ€™s powerful enough to learn nonlinear boundaries.
- **Visual + interactive:** Watch your neural net _draw_ the boundary as it learns.
- **Easy to hack:** Modify the number of neurons, activations, layers, learning rates â€” and instantly see what changes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- One hidden layer, ReLU activations
- Output sigmoid + cross-entropy loss
- Manual forward and backward propagation
- Fully vectorized NumPy implementation
- Decision boundary visualization
- Altair row limit disabled so the 300Ã—300 boundary grid always renders
- Clear, well-commented code

## Network Topology

| Layer  | Neurons | Activation |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- |
| Input  | 2       | â€”          |
| Hidden | 4       | ReLU       |
| Output | 1       | Sigmoid    |

## ðŸŽ¨ Example decision boundary

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

```bash
 pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
```

## ðŸ“‚ Project structure

```
 TinyNetLab/
 â”œâ”€â”€ tinynet.py        # Main code: network definition, Streamlit UI
 â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # This file
 â””â”€â”€ boundary_example.png # Example plot (optional)
```

## ðŸŒ± Get started

Launch the combined Streamlit interface and switch between apps:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Use the **Language** selector in the sidebar to switch between English and Chinese UI text.

### Individual apps

You can still run each demo separately:

```bash
streamlit run tinynet.py
```

```bash
streamlit run moons_streamlit.py
```

The Moons explorer shows how logistic regression performs on the dataset.
